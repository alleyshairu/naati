## Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project was to convert raw JSON based dialogues data into a readable LaTeX template for NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters) exam preparation.
The final output is a LaTeX file containing list dialogues that can be compiled into a single PDF.

## Features
- Converts raw JSON dialogues into a single LaTeX document.
- The LaTeX template follows the official NAATI format (highlighting the speaker and words count).

## How It Works

1. The input is a JSON file containing structured dialogues.
2. JSON content parsing.
3. The content is then mapped into a LaTeX template.
4. The output is a LaTeX file (`.tex`) that can be compiled into a PDF using XeLaTeX.

## Note
This program does not handle the PDF generation, I use XeLatex. If you already have XeLateX installed you might need to install additional packages and fonts for proper rendering, such as:

- **polyglossia**: For multilingual support (e.g., Urdu).
- **Urdu fonts**: Ensure that you have a compatible font installed for rendering Urdu text (`Jameel Noori Nastaleeq`).

To install these packages, you can use the following commands (assuming youâ€™re using a TeX distribution like TeX Live, Mac Tex):

```bash
sudo tlmgr install polyglossia
```
