## Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project was to convert JSON based dialogues data into a readable LaTeX template for NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters) exam preparation.
The final output is a LaTeX file containing list dialogues that can be compiled into a single PDF.

## Features
- Converts raw JSON dialogues into a single LaTeX document.
- The LaTeX template follows the official NAATI format (highlighting the speaker and words count).

## How It Works

1. The input is a JSON file containing structured dialogues.
2. JSON content parsing.
3. The content is then mapped into a LaTeX template.
4. The output is a LaTeX file (`.tex`) that can be compiled into a PDF using XeLaTeX.
